--Exact command used to train the model

1. Navigate to the yolov5-master directory. For example:
##Run the following command from inside the yolov5-master directory:

cd "C:\Users\Gabriel Krishna\Desktop\Alyssa\IFS 315\Vision-based System\Final Trained Model\yolov5-master"


2. Your dataset.yaml file is correctly located in the yolov5-master folder and contains the correct paths like:

train: ../raw_data/data/dataset/images/train
val: ../raw_data/data/dataset/images/val
nc: 11
names: ['apple', 'banana', 'carrot', 'corn', 'grapes', 'kiwi', 'lettuce', 'onion', 'pineapple', 'potato', 'tomato']
 
## You have YOLOv5 dependencies installed (including PyTorch and OpenCV).

## yolov5s.pt is present in the same directory (yolov5-master) or accessible via the internet to auto-download.

3. How to Train the Model Using Command Line

python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 50 --data dataset.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --name exp6

##Make sure you run the training from inside the yolov5-master folder with the correct data yaml and weights path
